# Welcome to Anvil's Material 3 theme

[Anvil](https://anvil.works)'s new [Material 3 theme](https://anvil.works/blog/introducing-material-3) defines components, layout forms and colour schemes to use in Anvil apps. The theme is based on the specs and guidelines of [Google's Material 3 theme](https://m3.material.io/)

The Material 3 theme is just an Anvil app that you can add as a [dependency](https://anvil.works/docs/deployment-new-ide/dependencies) to other Anvil apps. 

> [!Important]
> The Material 3 theme is still in beta while we work out the bugs, add more components and make it more user-friendly. If you'd like to help us improve the theme, check out our [contributing](/contributing.md) file to learn how to get involved!

## How to use the theme

It's easy! Log into [Anvil](https://anvil.works/build) and create a new M3 (Beta) app.

You can also add the theme to an existing app. Go to Settings -> Dependencies and  choose "Third Party". Enter the dependency ID "4UK6WHQ6UX7AKELK".

> [!Warning]
> If your app already contains an existing theme, it is possible that the theme CSS will disrupt the M3 theme. If you’re seeing strange results, try creating a new blank M3 app.
